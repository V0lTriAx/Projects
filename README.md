# About Me

I'm a developer focused on scripting, automation, and building lightweight tools. My current interests lie in languages like Lua, Bash, and Python. I enjoy working on small, functional projects that demonstrate core programming concepts and solve specific problems. This GitHub profile is where I share my learning journey and experiments with code.

I believe in building a strong foundation in the basics, writing clean and understandable code, and continuously learning new technologies.

## Projects

### Lua Number Guessing Game
**Language**: Lua  
**Repository**: [lua-guess-game](https://github.com/your-username/lua-guess-game)  
**Description**:  
A terminal-based number guessing game written in Lua. The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number with feedback provided after each attempt. This project demonstrates basic Lua syntax, control flow, user input handling, and the use of random number generation.

### Bash System Report Script
**Language**: Bash  
**Repository**: [bash-system-report](https://github.com/your-username/bash-system-report)  
**Description**:  
A Bash script that generates a timestamped system report, including uptime, memory and disk usage, top memory-consuming processes, and IP address details. This is a utility tool designed for quick system diagnostics on Unix-based systems. It demonstrates basic Bash scripting, command chaining, and file output.

## In Progress

- A CLI utility in Bash to organize files in a directory by file type.
- A simple text-based RPG game written in Lua.
- A shell-based task manager for personal productivity.

## Workflows Github

I'm a beginner developer focused on scripting, automation, and building lightweight, functional tools. My main interests lie in languages like **Lua**, **Bash**, and **Python**, which I use to develop terminal-based utilities, simple games, and productivity tools.

I enjoy learning by building, and every small project I create helps me understand programming concepts more deeply. Whether it's a game mechanic in Lua or a Bash script that generates system reports, I aim to write code that's simple, clear, and purposeful.

I'm currently working on expanding my skills by:
- Practicing Lua through game-like mini projects
- Writing Bash utilities that solve real problems on Unix-based systems
- Exploring version control and collaboration with Git and GitHub

As I grow, I plan to contribute to open source, learn more about web development and DevOps tools, and build tools that others can use or improve.

If you're also learning, feel free to connect or follow my projects here on GitHub.
