# About Me

I'm a developer focused on scripting, automation, and building lightweight tools. My current interests lie in languages like Lua, Bash, and Python. I enjoy working on small, functional projects that demonstrate core programming concepts and solve specific problems. This GitHub profile is where I share my learning journey and experiments with code.

I believe in building a strong foundation in the basics, writing clean and understandable code, and continuously learning new technologies.
